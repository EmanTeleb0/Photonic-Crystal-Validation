## About

The "Photonic Crystal Validation" project centers on validating the findings presented in a specific research article related to photonic crystal design. The article discusses the coupling characteristics of a dual-core hybrid plasmonic liquid crystal photonic crystal fiber (PCF), highlighting unique features and potential applications.

## Design Characteristics

The suggested structure outlined in the article exhibits the following characteristics:

- Dual-core configuration filled with nematic liquid crystal (NLC)
- Separation by a metallic wire
- Dual-core modes (even mode and odd mode) exhibit varying characteristics across wavelengths due to NLC infiltration
- Tunability through thermal and external electric field manipulation
- Potential use as a multiplexer-demultiplexer for wavelengths of 1.3 and 1.55 μm
- Broad bandwidths achieved around wavelengths of 1.3 and 1.55 μm, with low cross talk better than −20 dB

## Simulation and Validation

To validate the enhancements proposed in the plasmonic liquid photonic crystal design, this project employs COMSOL Multiphysics for rigorous simulations. The project involves:

- Deriving effective indices for even and odd modes
- Plotting attenuation and dispersion curves
- Investigating the coupling ratio's correlation with wavelength variations

The confirmed simulation results closely align with the findings outlined in the cited paper, contributing to the validation process.
